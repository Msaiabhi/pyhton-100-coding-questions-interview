🐍 Python Programming – Complete Reading Guide (Beginner Friendly)
📌 Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.

Python is designed to be:

Easy to read

Easy to write

Easy to understand

Unlike other languages, Python uses English-like syntax, which makes it ideal for beginners.

❓ Why Python?
Python is widely used because:

It has simple syntax

Requires less code

Works on multiple platforms

Has a huge library support

Used by top companies like Google, Netflix, Instagram

Python is both powerful and beginner-friendly.

🛠 Python Characteristics
Interpreted language → Code runs line by line

Dynamically typed → No need to declare variable types

Object-Oriented → Supports classes and objects

Open source → Free to use

Portable → Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux

📦 Installing Python
Download Python from the official website:
👉 https://www.python.org

Check installation:

python --version
👋 First Python Program
print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:
print() is a built-in function

It displays output on the screen

🧮 Variables in Python
A variable is used to store data in memory.

x = 10
name = "Python"
price = 99.99
Important Points:
No need to specify data type

Python automatically understands the type

🔢 Data Types
Data type defines what kind of data a variable stores.

Common Data Types:
int → Integer numbers

float → Decimal numbers

str → Text

bool → True or False

Example:

a = 10        # int
b = 10.5      # float
c = "Hello"   # string
d = True      # boolean
📚 Type Checking
x = 10
print(type(x))
🔀 Type Conversion
x = "10"
y = int(x)
🧠 Operators
Operators perform operations on values.

Types of Operators:
Arithmetic → + - * / %

Comparison → == != > <

Logical → and or not

Assignment → = += -=

Example:

a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)
🔁 Conditional Statements
Used to make decisions.

if Statement
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
if–else
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible")
else:
    print("Not Eligible")
elif
marks = 75
if marks >= 90:
    print("A Grade")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("B Grade")
else:
    print("Fail")
🔄 Loops
Loops are used to repeat code.

for Loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
while Loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
⛔ Loop Control Statements
break → Stops loop

continue → Skips current iteration

📦 Data Structures
List
Used to store multiple values.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Ordered

Changeable

Tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
Ordered

Not changeable (immutable)

Set
unique = {1, 2, 3}
No duplicates

Unordered

Dictionary
Stores data in key-value pairs.
student = {
    "name": "Abhinav",
    "age": 22
}
🧩 Functions
Functions are used to reuse code.

def add(a, b):
    return a + b
Calling function:

print(add(10, 20))
🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Class & Object
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print("Hello", self.name)

p = Person("Abhinav")
p.greet()
🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) in Python – Complete Explanation
📌 What is OOPS?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) is a programming approach where a program is designed using objects and classes instead of only functions and logic.

OOPS helps us:

Organize large programs

Reuse code

Reduce complexity

Make code easy to maintain and understand

Python fully supports OOPS concepts.

🔹 Core OOPS Concepts
Python OOPS is mainly based on six fundamental concepts:

Class

Object

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

We will explain each one clearly with examples and real-life meaning.

1️⃣ Class
📖 What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.

👉 It defines:

What data an object will have (variables)

What actions it can perform (methods)

🧠 Real-Life Example
Think of a Car blueprint:

It defines color, model, speed

But it is NOT a real car

🧑‍💻 Python Example
class Car:
    brand = "Toyota"
    color = "White"
Here:

Car is a class

brand and color are class variables

2️⃣ Object
📖 What is an Object?
An object is a real instance of a class.

👉 If class is a blueprint, object is the real thing created from it.

🧠 Real-Life Example
Blueprint → Car

Real car on road → Object

🧑‍💻 Python Example
car1 = Car()
print(car1.brand)
print(car1.color)
Here:

car1 is an object of class Car

3️⃣ Constructor (__init__ Method)
📖 What is a Constructor?
A constructor is a special method that:

Runs automatically when an object is created

Used to initialize (assign values to) object variables

In Python, constructor name is __init__.

🧑‍💻 Example
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

s1 = Student("Abhinav", 22)
print(s1.name)
print(s1.age)
🔍 Explanation
self refers to the current object

Values are passed during object creation

4️⃣ Encapsulation
📖 What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods together and protecting data from direct access.

👉 It helps in:

Data security

Controlled access

Avoiding accidental modification

🧠 Real-Life Example
ATM Machine:

You cannot directly access money

You use methods (withdraw, balance)

🔐 Access Modifiers in Python
Python uses naming conventions:

Type	Syntax	Meaning
Public	var	Accessible everywhere
Protected	_var	Accessible inside class & child
Private	__var	Accessible only inside class
🧑‍💻 Encapsulation Example
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__balance = 1000   # private variable

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

acc = BankAccount()
print(acc.get_balance())
👉 Direct access like acc.__balance ❌ not allowed

5️⃣ Inheritance
📖 What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows one class to use properties and methods of another class.

👉 It promotes code reusability.

🧠 Real-Life Example
Parent → Human

Child → Student (inherits features)

🧑‍💻 Python Example
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal makes sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        print("Dog barks")

d = Dog()
d.speak()
d.bark()
🔍 Explanation
Dog inherits from Animal

Dog can access speak() method

🔁 Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance

Multilevel Inheritance

Hierarchical Inheritance

Example – Multiple Inheritance
class A:
    def showA(self):
        print("Class A")

class B:
    def showB(self):
        print("Class B")

class C(A, B):
    pass

obj = C()
obj.showA()
obj.showB()
6️⃣ Polymorphism
📖 What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means one name, many forms.

👉 Same method name behaves differently in different classes.

🧠 Real-Life Example
Person can be a teacher, student, employee

Same person → different roles

🧑‍💻 Example – Method Overriding
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Bird can fly")

class Penguin(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        print("Penguin cannot fly")

b = Penguin()
b.fly()
👉 Same method fly() behaves differently

7️⃣ Abstraction
📖 What is Abstraction?
Abstraction means hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.

👉 User knows what to do, not how it works.

🧠 Real-Life Example
Driving a car

You use accelerator, brake

You don’t know engine internals

🧑‍💻 Python Abstraction Example
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Square(Shape):
    def area(self):
        print("Area = side * side")

s = Square()
s.area()
👉 Abstract class cannot be instantiated directly

8️⃣ self Keyword
📖 What is self?
Refers to current object

Used to access object variables and methods inside class

🧑‍💻 Example
class Demo:
    def show(self):
        print("Hello")

d = Demo()
d.show()
9️⃣ super() Keyword
📖 What is super()?
Used to call parent class constructor or methods.

🧑‍💻 Example
class Parent:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Parent constructor")

class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("Child constructor")

c = Child()
🔟 Benefits of OOPS
Code reusability

Better organization

Easy maintenance

Secure data

Real-world modeling
⚠ Exception Handling
Used to handle errors.

try:
    x = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("Error occurred")
📁 File Handling
Write File
file = open("data.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello Python")
file.close()
Read File
file = open("data.txt", "r")
print(file.read())
file.close()
📦 Modules
Modules help organize code.

import math
print(math.sqrt(25))
